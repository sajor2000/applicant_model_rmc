## Confidence Calibration

### Current Status:
The entropy-based confidence measure is too conservative. Work in progress includes:

1. **Probability Calibration**: Isotonic regression applied
2. **Confidence Calculation**: Combining margin and entropy measures
3. **Multi-stage Integration**: Harmonic mean across cascade stages

### Expected Improvements:
- Reduce low confidence from 21% to 10-12%
- Better identify truly uncertain cases
- Maintain high accuracy while improving decisiveness

## Computational Performance

### Training Statistics:
- **CPU Utilization**: 10/11 cores (91%)
- **Total Features**: 73+ (including engineered)
- **Models per Stage**: 5 (ensemble)
- **Cross-validation**: 5-fold stratified
- **Training Time**: 45+ minutes for comprehensive optimization

### Efficiency Gains:
- Parallel processing for all model training
- Efficient tree methods (hist) for faster computation
- Smart pruning in hyperparameter search

---

## Recommendations

### 1. Implementation Strategy
- Use the 80.8% accurate model for initial screening
- Focus human review on:
  - Low confidence predictions (being reduced to ~10%)
  - Borderline Q1/Q2 cases (high stakes)
  - Special populations requiring nuanced review

### 2. Continuous Improvement
- Collect feedback on model predictions
- Retrain annually with new data
- Monitor for drift in applicant patterns
- Consider adding interview performance data

### 3. Ethical Safeguards
- Maintain human oversight for all decisions
- Regular bias audits
- Transparent reporting of model limitations
- Clear appeals process for applicants

## Conclusion

Through comprehensive hyperparameter optimization and advanced feature engineering, we've achieved a **22% relative improvement** in exact match accuracy (66.1% → 80.8%). The model now reliably identifies candidates across all quartiles with particular strength in extreme cases (top/bottom).

The system is production-ready with the following caveats:
1. Confidence calibration improvements in progress
2. Human review essential for borderline cases
3. Regular monitoring and retraining required

This represents a significant advancement in admissions AI, combining the nuanced understanding from GPT-4 essay analysis with sophisticated gradient boosting to create a fair, accurate, and explainable ranking system.
