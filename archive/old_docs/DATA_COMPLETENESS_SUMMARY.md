# Data Completeness Summary - Medical Admissions System

## Executive Summary
All structured data has been standardized across years 2022-2024. Critical column naming issues have been resolved, particularly for Service Rating which was causing 98.7% false "Reject" predictions.

## ✅ Data Standardization Complete

### Critical Fixes Applied:
1. **Service Rating**: `Service Rating (Numerical)` → `service_rating_numerical` (consistent across all years)
2. **AMCAS ID**: Multiple variations → `amcas_id` (standardized)
3. **Application Review Score**: Standardized to `application_review_score`
4. **All column names**: Now using consistent snake_case format

### Structured Data Availability:

#### ✅ Complete Features (Available All Years):
- **Demographics**: age, gender, citizenship
- **Socioeconomic**: first_generation_ind, disadvantaged_ind, ses_value, pell_grant
- **Experience Hours**: 
  - healthcare_total_hours (100% complete)
  - exp_hour_volunteer_med (90% complete)
  - exp_hour_shadowing (87% complete)
  - exp_hour_employ_med (73% complete)
  - exp_hour_research (available)
  - exp_hour_volunteer_non_med (available)
- **Service Ratings**: service_rating_numerical, service_rating_categorical
- **Target Variable**: application_review_score

#### ⚠️ Partially Available Features:
- **GPA Trends**: Only in 2022 data
  - total_gpa_trend
  - bcpm_gpa_trend
- **Previous Application**: prev_applied_rush (15-17% missing)
- **Military Status**: military_service_status (98-99% missing)

#### ❌ Missing Critical Features (Not in Dataset):
- **MCAT Scores**: No columns exist for MCAT data
- **Actual GPA Values**: Only trends available, not actual GPAs
- **Clinical Hours**: Named differently - use healthcare_total_hours instead

## File Consistency
- **2022**: 12 Excel files, 63 features in applicants file
- **2023**: 12 Excel files, 60 features in applicants file  
- **2024**: 12 Excel files, 60 features in applicants file
- Minor file naming difference: "Schools.xlsx" (2022-23) vs "School.xlsx" (2024)

## Data Quality Metrics

### Missing Data Summary (Top Issues):
1. **Description Fields**: 95-100% missing (not critical for modeling)
2. **Military Status**: 98-99% missing
3. **Previous Application**: 83-88% missing
4. **GPA Trends**: 100% missing in 2023-2024

### Data Type Consistency:
- Most fields consistent across years
- Minor type changes in text fields (object vs float64 for empty fields)

## Impact on Model

### Previous Issue:
- Service Rating column name mismatch caused model to miss #1 feature (20.6% importance)
- Result: 98.7% of 2024 applicants incorrectly predicted as "Reject"

### After Standardization:
- All critical features now accessible with consistent names
- Ready for model retraining with proper feature extraction
- Expected significant improvement in 2024 predictions

## Next Steps

1. **Immediate**: Retrain model using standardized data
2. **Short-term**: 
   - Add GPA trend calculation for 2023-2024 if source data available
   - Implement fallback for missing military status
3. **Long-term**:
   - Acquire MCAT scores and actual GPA values
   - These are likely the most predictive missing features

## File Locations
- **Standardized Data**: `/data_standardized/{year}_standardized/`
- **Column Mappings**: `column_mappings.json`
- **Detailed Analysis**: `data_completeness_analysis.json`
- **Reports**: 
  - `column_standardization_report.txt`
  - `data_completeness_report.txt`

## Conclusion
Structured data is now properly standardized and accessible across all years. The critical Service Rating issue has been resolved. Model retraining with standardized data should restore proper prediction performance.
